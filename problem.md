TASK 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

1.	Start
2.	Ask the user to enter N 
3.	Ask the user to enter n
4.	if N % n = 0 then n is a divisor of N
5.	else 
6.	n is not a divisor of N
7.	If N % 2 = 0 then N is even
8.	else N is odd
9.	END
