Task 3: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)
1.	Start
2.	Ask user to enter Number1
3.	Ask user to enter Operator
4.	Ask user to enter Number2
5.	If Operator = “+” then set Result = Number1 + Number2
6.	Else If Operator = “-” then set Result = Number1 – Number2
7.	Else If Operator = “*” then set Result = Number1 * Number2
8.	Else If Operator = “/” then set Result = Number1 / Number2
9.	Else If Operator = “%” then set Result = Number1 % Number2
10.	Else print “Syntax error”
11.	Print Result
12.	End
